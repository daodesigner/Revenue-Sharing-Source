    "description": "This snuff box, collected by Magnus Leijer, reflects the intricate craftsmanship of Zambia. Leijer, a prominent figure known for his contributions as a big game hunter, vice consul, and a significant collector of African artifacts, acquired this piece in 1909. The box symbolizes the cultural heritage and practices surrounding snuff use in Zambia. Furthermore, the piece was part of a collection visit by Victoria Phiri Chitungu in 2022, underlining the ongoing exploration and sharing of Zambian and Swedish heritage through projects like 'Empowering Women's Histories: Sharing Digital Heritage between Zambia and Sweden'.",
