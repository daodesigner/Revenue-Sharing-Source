    "description": "This girdle or belt, adorned with cowrie shells and dating back to 1894, is a testament to the craftsmanship and cultural heritage of the Mbunda people from Zambia. Collected by Emil Holub, a Czech explorer and ethnographer, during his extensive travels in Africa, this item represents the rich cultural exchanges between Africa and Europe in the late 19th century. Holub's contributions to ethnographic collections have provided invaluable insights into the material culture of Central and Southern African societies.",
